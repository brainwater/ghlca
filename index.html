<a name="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>My motivation for starting the GitHub Large Code Analysis project was not in fact the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge">Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge</a>, instead around January 2014 I was interested in doing some sort of BigData type analysis, however I had almost no idea where to start. I came up with the idea to download a bunch of repositories from GitHub and see what I could find by analyzing  all of that code. Of course, like most of my ideas, I promptly forgot about it after getting really excited about it for a week and then realized it would take real work. Later I was reading <a href="news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and came across an article about <a href="http://awgn.github.io/cgrep/">Cgrep</a>, which sparked my interest in the ghlca project again. I also came across another article about <a href="http://corte.si/posts/code/devsurvey/">The impact of language choice on github projects</a>, which was very much like part of what I wanted to do in the ghlca project. The final thing which got me working on the ghlca project was when a coworker asked if I had heard about the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge">Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge</a>, which finally gave me a deadline.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Aldo Cortesi (<a href="https://github.com/cortesi" class="user-mention">@cortesi</a>) for his post on his work downloading a bunch of github repositories at <a href="http://corte.si/posts/code/devsurvey/">The impact of language choice on github projects</a>.</p>
