{"name":"GitHub Large Code Analysis (ghlca)","tagline":"What can be discovered if you download thousands of GitHub repositories?","body":"### Motivation\r\nMy motivation for starting the GitHub Large Code Analysis project was not in fact the [Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge), instead around January 2014 I was interested in doing some sort of BigData type analysis, however I had almost no idea where to start. I came up with the idea to download a bunch of repositories from GitHub and see what I could find by analyzing  all of that code. Of course, like most of my ideas, I promptly forgot about it after getting really excited about it for a week and then realized it would take real work. Later I was reading [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com) and came across an article about [Cgrep](http://awgn.github.io/cgrep/), which sparked my interest in the ghlca project again. I also came across another article about [The impact of language choice on github projects](http://corte.si/posts/code/devsurvey/), which was very much like part of what I wanted to do in the ghlca project. The final thing which got me working on the ghlca project was when a coworker asked if I had heard about the [Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge), which finally gave me a deadline.\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nI would like to thank Aldo Cortesi (@cortesi) for his post on his work downloading a bunch of github repositories at [The impact of language choice on github projects](http://corte.si/posts/code/devsurvey/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
